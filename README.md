This tutorial teaches the basics of building a web API with ASP.NET Core.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

    Create a web api project.
    Add a model class.
    Create the database context.
    Register the database context.
    Add a controller.
    Add CRUD methods.
    Configure routing and URL paths.
    Specify return values.
    Call the web API with Postman.
    Call the web api with jQuery.

At the end, you have a web API that can manage "to-do" items stored in a relational database.
